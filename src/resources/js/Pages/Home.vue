      Hello! This is my technical assessment for Curotec. Thank you for your time â€” I hope you enjoy reviewing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this project, I implemented a dynamic data grid system with filtering and pagination.
    </p>

    <p>
      The backend structure is designed to be dynamic and easily extendable. I used a base repository abstract class,
      and each list is powered by a generator command that makes it effortless to scaffold new endpoints. To add a new
      list, you only need to create a controller and resource to consume the generated structure.
    </p>


    <h3>Some of the features I developed</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Dynamic data grids on the Movies and Users pages, consuming backend list API endpoints.
      </li>

      <li>
        Scheduled jobs and queued workers that automatically generate new users and movies.
      </li>

      <li>
        Comprehensive feature tests to ensure all core functionality works as expected.
      </li>
    </ul>
